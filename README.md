#What is this?
A small collection of scripts that are intended to help with random painful chores within Jira.  I mean, Jira will still be painful, but this might help just a little.

#How to use them
Most of these scripts are intended to be used within the [ScriptRunner plugin](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/6820) running within Jira Cloud.  

They are written in Groovy and use Unirest (which is already imported into ScriptRunner.

#Do they work?
Maybe?  These were done late at night, usually out of frustration.  If they zap your Jira instance, or cause some other terribleness, please don't flame me and blow up my inbox.  Maybe Trello is for you after all?
